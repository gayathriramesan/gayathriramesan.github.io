Living systems continuously process and respond to non-stationary signals on multiple
scales, starting from single cells to neuronal networks. In order to accurately
interpret the signals and generate coordinated response, the computations must occur
in real-time and have distinct features, including specificity in responses as well
as generalisation of signals, flexibility in response to novel signals, and tolerance to
noise, among others. The current paradigms describing natural computation mainly
focus on Turing-like computations, that from aspect of dynamical systems resemble
computations with stable steady states. However, switching between steady states is
not generally compatible with efficient processing of non-stationary signals. I propose
to investigate computation with non-asymptotic transients in networks characterised
with “ghost” or attractor ruin sets. Formulating mathematically how to study attractor
ruins, we will investigate the generality of ghost-network computations as a
basis for natural computations, life-long and on-the-fly learning.
